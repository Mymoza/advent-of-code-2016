# advent-of-code-2016
Repository for my participation to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 2016!

## Day 1 
Special thanks to [blob](https://github.com/iboshkov/AdventOfCode/blob/master/Day1.py)

## Day 2 
I thought that [ultramega](https://github.com/ultramega/adventofcode2016/blob/master/day2/part1.py) had a really nice and clean code so I took some inspiration from his code :)

## Python 3.0
Everything is coded in Python 3.0 since I want to practice that language a bit!
